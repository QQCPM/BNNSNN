# 🎯 Uncertainty Monster Pet

**Educational demo showing three approaches to uncertainty in AI**

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **🧠 Bayesian Neural Networks**: How neural networks can express confidence in predictions
- **⚡ Spiking Neural Networks**: How biological timing variability affects computation
- **📊 Statistical Analysis**: How moments and distributions quantify uncertainty

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_simple.txt

# Test models work
python test_models.py

# Run the demo
python run_demo.py
```

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Interact with your pet** → generates data
2. **See three uncertainty approaches**:
   - Bayesian: "75% happy ± 10% confidence"
   - Temporal: Spike patterns vary with same input
   - Statistical: Distribution shows mood patterns

## 🎓 Educational Focus

- **Hands-on uncertainty**: Abstract concepts made tangible
- **Comparative learning**: Three different approaches to same problem
- **Progressive understanding**: Watch confidence improve with more data
- **Visual learning**: Real-time charts show uncertainty evolution

**Perfect for learning how AI systems handle and communicate uncertainty!**
